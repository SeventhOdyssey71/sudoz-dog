            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              The SUDOZ project is entirely fictional. All narratives involving animals, including dogs or experiments, are part of a creative storyline. These depictions do not reflect real-world actions, beliefs, or intentions. No animals were harmed, nor is harm promoted in any way through this project.

            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              SUDOZ is designed as a gamified and experimental NFT ecosystem. Features such as "leveling up," "burning," and "evolution" are metaphorical mechanics for user interaction and engagement. Participation in these features is entirely optional.

              Any SUI or cryptocurrency used to interact with the project (e.g., level-ups, transactions) is spent voluntarily. These actions are initiated by the user and are non-refundable. The project creators do not hold responsibility for individual financial decisions.

              SUDOZ makes no promises or guarantees regarding the financial value of any NFTs, including Dog NFTs or Artifacts. The floor price, resale value, and market performance are determined solely by the open market and community consensus.
